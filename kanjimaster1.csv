COUNTER
Japanese count big money in units of 10,000. They don't for instance, have a word for 'million.' -- a million is actually called 100万. Which would be logical if it were written with 万-sized commas： 100,0000 . . . but it's written with rest-of-the-planet commas, like this: 1,000,000. I'm sure some asshole thought he was doing the rest of the world a favor with this compromise, but actually that just makes it more confusing for everyone. Probably it was the same motherless douche who decided to import all the on-yomi from China and get them all wrong.
Anyway.

Masochists tend to gaman when they're fed worms while tied up.

Sometimes the concept of gaman DOES overlap with the English idea of patience, though: Little kids have to gaman if they find out that Disneyland is still 4 hours away.

One possible way to make GAMAN fit with the theme of 'neglect' is to remember that the 'ga' part means 'self.' So GAMAN means 'neglect yourself,' or, more poetically, 'Stop feeling the pain of your body and mind, and concentrate on the task at hand.'

BOOBOO: people think this means ""ASIA,"" but it doesn't. A while ago, just as a pun, some Japanese decided to spell the word ""ASIA"" phonetically, using kanji, like so: 亜細亜：あじあ: but this custom never caught on. And besides, the 亜 kanji was only chosen for its sound, not for its meaning.

亜 is used in a lot of names of elements, like chalk or zinc, but unless you're a research chemist or terrorist, this doesn't concern you.

亜熱帯：あねったい： subtropical region
